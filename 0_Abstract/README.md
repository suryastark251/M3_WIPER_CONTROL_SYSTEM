# PROJECT TITLE - WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM

# ABSTRACT :

 A wiper is a vital component that cleans raindrops or any other liquid from the windscreen of a car. Previously, the wipers had to be activated manually by setting the frequency. The operation of increasing the wiper speed is modified as a result. The project's purpose is to improve the systems of older cars by providing automated transmission. wiping technology, to improve the system by including a sensor and actuator, and to develop a basic programme that would work with the system completely. the structure The principle of this proposed wiper system is similar to that of other existing conventional wipers. Regardless of the fact that To drain water from the windscreen, this system will be updated to an automatic control system using a Peripheral Interface.
